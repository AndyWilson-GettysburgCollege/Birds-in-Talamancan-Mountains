Files are in zipped folders to save disk space, as follows:

2. "Bird_data.zip" zipped folder of cvs file with xy coordiantes of eBird* data observations for each species, for years 2006-2015
3. "elevation" zipped folder of geotiff of digital elevation model
4. "ecosystem_type.zip" zipped folder of geotiff of ecosystem type (see paper text for derivation)
5. "modis landcover.zip" zipped folder of geotiff of MODIS landcover
6. "Maps for species names B to M" zipped folder of geotiffs of species maps with English Common names B through M
7. "Maps for species names O to Y" zipped folder of geotiffs of species maps with English Common names O through Y

Items 6 and 7 include 5 maps for each species:

i) species_name_baseline - estimated species distribution in 2006-2015
ii) species_name_RCP26 - estimated species distribution in 2070 under Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6
iii) species_name_RCP45 - estimated species distribution in 2070 under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5
iv) species_name_RCP60 - estimated species distribution in 2070 under Representative Concentration Pathway 6.0
v) species_name_RCP85 - estimated species distribution in 2070 under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
